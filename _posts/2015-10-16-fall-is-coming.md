Fall is coming, you can feel it. Even though the sun is still shining warmly and bright, change is in the air. The water today feels restless. Fierce. Not at all like the summer with its cool waves lapping up at the sand. It's an ever churning, ever rolling repeat of wave after wave after wave. Never tiring. Helping the world move on from lazy summer to hard working fall. Feel this spirit. This never tiring always turning spirit. Take it and run free and fierce. Run til the work is complete. Run and be careless in the care of the universe. Work fiercely. Draw strength.
